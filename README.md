# FLOW-Builder

**Live Demo:** [https://flowbuilder-gamma.vercel.app/](https://flowbuilder-gamma.vercel.app/)

FLOW-Builder is an interactive flow creation tool where you can visually design and connect different nodes to build custom workflows.  
Currently, the builder supports creating **Message Nodes**, but more node types will be added in the future.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Add Nodes** â€“ Create new message nodes in the flow.
- **Add Edges** â€“ Connect nodes with directional edges.
- **Remove Nodes & Edges** â€“ Delete unwanted elements from the flow.
- **Drag & Position** â€“ Move nodes freely to organize your layout.
- **Save Your Flow** â€“ Store your flow in local storage and load it later.
- **Validation** â€“ Ensures that every node (except the first) has at least one incoming edge before saving.

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

- Add different types of nodes (e.g., Decision Node, API Call Node, Delay Node, etc.).
- Allow exporting and importing flows in JSON format.
- Add styling options for nodes and edges.
- Implement collaborative real-time flow editing.
